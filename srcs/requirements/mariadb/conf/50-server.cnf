# 1 MariaDB server initialization and overall configuration.
# 3 This specifies an SQL file (init.sql) that will be executed at the start of the MariaDB server.
	It could contain commands to set up the database, tables, users, etc., when the server starts.
# 5 the main configuration for the MariaDB server (mysqld is the name of the server daemon)
# 7 This allows MariaDB to accept connections from any IP address, meaning it will listen on all
	network interfaces. By default, MariaDB listens on 127.0.0.1 (localhost), but this setting makes
	it accessible from external machines. This is typically useful for Docker setups or when accessing
	the database remotely

# 10 the default administrative user
# 11 the location where the MariaDB process ID file will be stored, helps the system manage and track the MariaDB server process
# 12 the root installation directory of MariaDB.
# 13 where MariaDB saves the database information
# 14 Itâ€™s used for storing temporary files during query execution and other operations

# 17 how long binary logs are kept before they are automatically deleted,
	Binary logs store changes to the database for replication and backup purposes
# 18 Sets the default character set for the server to utf8mb4, which is a more comprehensive UTF-8 encoding
	that supports all Unicode characters (including emojis)
# 19 Defines the default collation for the server. Collation determines how strings are compared and sorted.
	utf8mb4_general_ci is a case-insensitive collation for utf8mb4 character set.
